# Examproject

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook used for the exam.

**Note:** All functions are in seperate modules.

The first part of the exam is solving a labour supply model in two period, where the worker accumulates human capital, when working in period 1 and thus increases the wage in period 2. 
This becomes interesting when the moel includes unemployment benfits.

The second part involves an AS/AD-model, that we wish to solve. We do that by using Sympy. We simulate a single period demand shock and evaluate the impulse response of output and inflation. Moreover we simulate stochastic process of demand and supply shocks. We evaluate the affect that phi has on the statistics of the process of inflation and output,and optimize the value of phi in order to obtain the same correlation between inflation and output as in the US economy. Lastly, we optimize phi and the standard deviations of the demand and supply shock in order to obtain the same variance and autocorrelation of both inflation and output and the correlation of output and inflation as in the US economy.

The last part involves an Edgeworth-type exchange economy with three goods and multiple comsumers. We find the Walrasian equilibrium and evaluate the effect of initial endowments and gamma on the utility.
