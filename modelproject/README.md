# Modelproject

In this project we solve and evaluate a microfounded labour supply model.

     - We describe and solve the model and introduce a tax rate increase and examine the effects quantitively and visually, by splitting the income and substitution effect.
     - We solve the model numerically. Moreover, we include a top tax rate to examine the effects and find that there is a bunching regarding labor supply below the top tax margin, as one would expect due to the marginal tax rate being higher.
      - Lastly, we examine the effect of the changing the labour suuply elasticity and present the results visually with an animation.

     Note: Some functions are defined in seperate modules.
