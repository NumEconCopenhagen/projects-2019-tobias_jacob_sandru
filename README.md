# This repository contains:
	* A data project where we arrange data from Statistics Denmark regarding the projected population in Denmark and include similar statistics from Sweden and Norway

	* A model project where we simulate a labour supply model numerically and analytically. This includes raising the tax on labour income and introducing a progressive tax system.

	* Lastly an exam project where we analyze and evaluate different models. The first is a labour supply model in two periods with human capital accumulation. The next is an AS/AD-model, where we simulate for a single period shock and stochastic shocks and evaluate and compare to the US economy. In the last part of the exam project we analyze a Edgeworth-alike exchange economy with multiple consumers and three goods.




# Welcome to your NumEconCPH repository
	# Data Project - Population Growth
	
	We have provided you with the following repository that contains the required structure for this course. **You should not change any folders in the root directory**.
	
	A short description of the files and folders:
	
	* [README.md](/README.md): gives a short introduction to your project. You should change this file so it gives an introduction to what your repository consists of, and how to run the code to get your output. The present README file is always present on [github](https://www.github.com/numeconcopenhagen/numeconcopenhagen-2018/blob/master/README.md).
	* [/binder](/binder/): The folder is used by mybinder.org to setup an interactive version of your repository. For details see this [guide](https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com/guides/mybinder/).
	* [/dataproject](/dataproject): The structure is as follows: it contains a jupyter notebook where all the results should be presented. Furthermore, there is a python module named the dataproject where you can write and structure all your code.
	* [/examproject](/examproject): Same structure as above.
	* [/modelproject](/modelproject): Same structure as above.
	* [.gitignore](/.gitignore): A textfile specifying files and folder that will not be uploaded to github, and will not be tracked by git.
